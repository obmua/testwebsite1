AGovC Vision
The task of the liberation of the homeland in the twenty first century cannot be isolated from our history, socio-economic context, the illegality of the occupation of Ambazonia by Cameroun, the nature of the occupying Camerounâ€™s forces and administrators in our Ambazonia homeland, and the
global political and economic system. In this regard, we do not envision our path to freedom as a walk in the park. Therefore, the simultaneous applications of broad and collaborative mobilization of the Ambazonia people and the peoples of the world at large, diplomatic support from countries and
institutions, and the right to self-defense are imperative.

For the liberation front and its AGovC leadership, the prosecution of the human right of Ambazonians to self-determination must be relentless and rooted in discipline, steadfastness, continuous selflessness, sacrifice of material resources for the freedom of the homeland, strategy and tactfulness, justice, and collective action in a spirit of camaraderie.
